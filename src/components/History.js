        <p>
          The company was founded in 1995 by a group of friends who shared a
          passion for coding and a desire to create innovative software
          solutions. Initially, they focused on developing custom applications
          for local businesses, but their work soon caught the attention of
          larger clients.

        <p>
          In 2000, the company released its first commercial product, a project
          management tool that quickly gained popularity among small to
          medium-sized businesses. This success led to significant growth and
          the need for additional funding, which was secured through a series of
          investments.

          In recent years, the company has continued to innovate, exploring new
          technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of
          Things (IoT). These efforts have positioned the company for continued
